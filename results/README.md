# Results

This folder contains the results of our projector correction experiments.

- **Initial Test (Blue Screen)**:  
  We tested the correction methods on a blue screen. See `blue_screen_correction.png` for the results.

- **Irregular Surface Test**:  
  We evaluated system performance when projecting onto an irregular surface. Results are in `diff_test_results`.

- **Data Analysis**:  
  The spreadsheet used to compute metrics is available as `data_analysis.xlsx`.

- **Evaluation Graph**:  
  Distance metrics for the various correction methods are visualized in `results.png`.
